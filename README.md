# Flu-Shot-Analysis-2022

Overview

This project analyzes flu shot administration in 2022, using patient encounter data to uncover key insights into vaccination trends, demographic disparities, and the impact of seasonal factors. The goal is to help healthcare providers improve vaccination outreach, enhance patient engagement, and make data-driven decisions to boost flu shot compliance.

Problem Definition

Public health organizations aim to increase flu shot coverage, but several challenges hinder vaccination efforts:

Understanding key drivers of flu shot compliance and identifying which demographics are most or least likely to get vaccinated.

Assessing disparities in vaccination rates across different racial, age, and regional groups.

This analysis addresses these challenges by providing actionable insights that can improve flu shot outreach strategies, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately increase vaccination rates.

Objectives

Understand Flu Shot Compliance ‚Äì Analyze the influence of demographics, regional factors, and healthcare access on vaccination rates.

Assess Patient Behavior ‚Äì Identify trends in flu shot uptake based on patient age, race, and location.

Datasets

The project utilizes four datasets sourced from hospital records, each providing essential information for analysis:

1. Conditions Dataset

Includes patient medical conditions and their encounter details.

Helps identify correlations between pre-existing conditions and flu shot compliance.

2. Encounters Dataset

Contains records of hospital visits, including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency encounters.

Provides insights into how healthcare access influences flu shot administration.

3. Immunizations Dataset

Tracks all administered vaccines, including flu shots.

Used to measure overall compliance and identify seasonal trends in flu shot administration.

4. Patients Dataset

Contains demographic details such as age, race, gender, and location.

Critical for understanding flu shot uptake across different population segments.

Key Findings

1. Flu Shots by Age

Age groups 0-17 and 50+ had the highest compliance rate.

Age groups 18-49 had lower vaccination rates, suggesting the need for targeted awareness campaigns.

2. Flu Shots by Race

Vaccination rates varied significantly across racial groups, with some demographics showing lower compliance.

Addressing racial disparities could improve overall flu shot coverage through better outreach strategies.

3. Flu Shot % by County

Some counties had significantly lower flu shot uptake, indicating geographic disparities in vaccine access or awareness.

Higher compliance in certain counties suggests successful public health initiatives in those areas.

4. Running Sum of Flu Shots 2022

Flu shot administration steadily increased throughout the year, peaking between October and December, aligning with flu season.

A mid-year slump suggests a potential opportunity to increase vaccinations during the summer months through targeted campaigns.

5. Total Compliance & Flu Shots Given

81.8% of eligible patients received their flu shot in 2022.

A total of 8,100 flu shots were administered throughout the year.

Challenges Faced

Data Integration ‚Äì Merging multiple datasets while ensuring accuracy in patient matching and encounter tracking.

Geographic Limitations ‚Äì Some counties had incomplete vaccination data, making regional analysis less precise.

Recommendations

Increase targeted awareness campaigns for age groups 18-49 to boost flu shot compliance, especially in younger populations.

Implement culturally relevant outreach programs to reduce racial disparities in flu shot uptake.

Expand public health initiatives in low-performing counties by improving vaccine accessibility and education.

Encourage proactive vaccination scheduling before the flu season peak (September‚ÄìDecember) to maximize coverage.

Introduce summer vaccination drives to address the mid-year slump and ensure consistent flu shot administration.

Enhance data collection efforts in underrepresented counties to improve regional flu shot analysis.
